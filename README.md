# Defending OT with ATT&CK

Defending Operational Technology (OT) with ATT&CK  is a Center for Threat-Informed
Defense (Center) project that provides a customized collection of [MITRE
ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) techniques tailored to the attack surface and threat
model for OT environments. A typical OT environment spans multiple platforms (e.g., Linux and 
Microsoft Azure) and even spans technology domains (e.g., Enterprise and ICS). These complex 
environments require cyber defenders to track adversary behaviors that are defined across 
multiple matrices and platforms in the ATT&CK knowledgebase. Keeping track of techniques across 
different ATT&CK matrices can be difficult, and some techniques may not apply to a particular 
environment or architecture. To that end, this project defines a reference architecture and a 
corresponding attack surface, then creates mappings of relevant techniques from multiple matrices 
to provide a single, convenient collection of resources. The resultant collection can be used
by organizations that use OT to understand and describe adversary activities and impact on assets 
across an environment, conduct strategic adversarial simulations, evaluate and employ security 
controls for real-world adversary behaviors, and conduct cyber tabletop excerises.

## Getting Started

To get started, visit the project website. The project website provides:
- an overview of the project,
- the reference architecture of assets and technologies used in IT/OT hybrid environments,
- the customized threat collection of ATT&CK techniques for OT environments,
- the five-step threat modeling methodology approach used,
- use cases to demonstrate how project resources can be employed, and
- an ATT&CK-based cyber tabletop exercise scenario.
