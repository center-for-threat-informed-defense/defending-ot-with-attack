# Defending OT with ATT&CK

Defending Operational Technology (OT) with ATT&CK  is a Center for Threat-Informed
Defense (Center) project that provides a customized collection of [MITRE
ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) techniques tailored to the attack surface and threat
model for OT environments. The collection of threats contained in the ATT&CK
knowledgebase, including historical attacks against OT, are used to define a reference
architecture and technology domains of interest for OT. The resultant collection can be
used by organizations that use OT to evaluate and employ security controls for
real-world adversary behaviors.
