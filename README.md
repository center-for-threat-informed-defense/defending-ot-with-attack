# Defending OT with ATT&CK

Defending Operational Technology (OT) with ATT&CK  is a Center for Threat-Informed Defense (Center) 
project that provides a customized collection of [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) techniques tailored to the 
attack surface and threat model for OT environments. The collection of threats contained 
in the ATT&CK knowledgebase, including historical attacks against OT, are used to define a 
reference architecture and technology domains of interest for OT. The resultant collection 
can be used by organizations that use OT to evaluate and employ security controls for 
real-world adversary behaviors.

This work builds upon the Center's [Defending IaaS with ATT&CK](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/our-work/defending-iaas-with-attack/) project by using 
the methodology and tooling created under that project as a basis. Defending OT with ATT&CK
provides an additional collection of resources cyber defenders can use to understand and make 
threat-informed decisions for techniques that could be used within an IT/OT hybrid architecture 
and environment.
