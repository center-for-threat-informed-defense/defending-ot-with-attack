Use Cases
=========

The Defending OT with ATT&CK reference architecture, threat collection, and methodology are 
valuable resources for cyber professionals encompassing many roles and responsibilities 
associated with organizational cyber defense, risk management, and threat prevention. The 
resources provide a customized collection of adversary behaviors tailored to the attack surface 
and threat model for OT environments that support a variety of capabilities and use cases. The 
following is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but rather examples to demonstrate how project 
resources could be used.

Users
-----

The existing communities providing, securing, and maintaining OT systems and 
environments include many roles and responsibilities associated with cybersecurity 
processes and procedures. These roles and responsibilities include:

**Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**
     Responsible for carrying out information security policies, procedures, and controls, 
     and providing primary interface between senior managers and information system owners.
     
**Information System Security Officer (ISSO)**
     Responsibilities include ensuring the appropriate operational security posture 
     is maintained for information systems or programs.

**Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Analyst**
     Responsibilities include collecting data and information from across the threat 
     landscape to identify, assess, and recommend countermeasures for cyber threats.
     
**Red Team (RT) Engineer**
     Responsibilities include conducting security exercises that emulate real-world 
     cyber threats to assess and improve the effectiveness of defensive measures.

**Security Engineer (SE)**
     Responsibilities include identifying, developing, and implementing security controls 
     and solutions to protect networks and systems from unauthorized access and attacks.
     
Usage
-----

Defending OT with ATT&CK enables the following essential capabilities:

**Threat Intelligence Mapping**
     Users can leverage ATT&CK's full range of OT-related technique mappings used by 
     real-world threat actors to describe adversary activities during a security event 
     and understand how their behaviors may impact assets across an environment.

**Red Teaming and Penetration Testing** 
     Users can apply the project resources to conduct strategic adversarial simulations, 
     including red teaming and penetration testing, to effectively evaluate real-world 
     risks across the attack surface.

**Security Architecture and Operations** 
     Users can use the mapped information to more easily identify security control gaps 
     to protect systems and environments from threats, develop detections for adversary 
     activity, and plan appropriate response activities across their IT/OT environment.

**Cyber Tabletop Exercises** 
     Users can use project resources to conduct collaborative cyber tabletop exercises 
     that passively evaluate adversarial risks and use combined participant knowledge and 
     expertise to evaluate the employed organizational mitigating security technologies.

User Stories
------------

This section describes user stories based on the roles identified above. These user stories 
are expressed as the who, what, and why, with a short exploration of how a user story may be 
achieved.

**As a CISO/ISSO, I want to understand how our current security posture addresses real-world threats that my organization is likely to encounter:**
     Defending OT with ATT&CK provides a customized collection of ATT&CK techniques tailored 
     to the attack surface and threat model for OT environments. The resulting resources can 
     be used to conduct threat vector based compromise scenarios based on real-world adversary 
     behaviors targeting IT/OT environments. These scenarios provide understanding of actual 
     threats and risks and that knowledge can be applied to evaluate and employ appropriate 
     security controls and mitigations.

**As a CTI analyst, I need to know that we have sufficient countermeasures for threats against my organization:**
     The Defending OT with ATT&CK resources can be used by CTI analysts to understand and 
     evaluate adversary activities associated specifically with OT systems and environments. 
     Visiting the narrative pages for the mapped ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques will 
     provide information about behavior detections and mitigations, and often include links 
     to available tools. This information can help CTI analysts recommend countermeasures 
     for their IT/OT environments.

**As a RT engineer, I want to have a complete picture of my organization's attack surface and how it can be abused, to improve defensive measures:**
     The Defending OT with ATT&CK mappings provide a framework to comprehensively describe 
     adversary behaviors at a flexible level across multiple platforms and technology domains. 
     The resources provide RT engineers with adversarial techniques and scenarios that can be 
     used for understanding their attack surface and identifying cyber defensive capabilities 
     to mitigate threats to their systems and environments.
     
**As a SE, I want to understand what mitigations are necessary to prevent classes of attacker activity:**
     SEs can use the Defending OT with ATT&CK resources to evaluate and employ security controls 
     and mitigations for real-world adversary behaviors associated specifically with attacks targeting 
     IT/OT systems used in OT environments. Most ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques include information about 
     relevant mitigations, and examination and correlation of these can suggest control improvements 
     that can mitigate entire classes of adversary activity as well as individual threats.
