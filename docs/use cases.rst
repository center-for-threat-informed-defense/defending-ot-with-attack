Use Cases
=========

The Defending OT collection and methodology support the following basic use cases.

Users
-----

The existing communities providing, securing, and maintaining OT systems and 
environments include many roles and responsibilities associated with cybersecurity 
processes and procedures. These roles and responsibilities include:

**Incident Response (IR) Professional**
     Responsibilities include response, management, coordination, and remediation 
     activities for cyber incidents such as malware infections, data theft, ransomware 
     encryption, denial of service, and control systems intrusions.

**Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**
     Responsibilities include carrying out information security policies, procedures, 
     and controls, and providing the primary interface between senior managers and 
     information system owners.

**Information System Security Officer (ISSO)**
     Responsibilities include ensuring the appropriate operational security posture 
     is maintained for information systems or programs.

**Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst**
     Responsibilities include monitoring an organization's networks and systems to 
     detect threats and investigating potential security incidents.

**Security Engineer (SE)**
     Responsibilities include identifying, developing, and implementing security controls 
     and solutions to protect networks and systems from unauthorized access and attacks.

Usage
-----

Defending OT with ATT&CK enables the following essential capabilities:

**Threat Intelligence Mapping**
     Users can leverage ATT&CK's full range of OT-related technique mappings used by 
     real-world threat actors to describe adversary activities during a security event 
     and understand how their behaviors may impact assets across an environment.

**Cybersecurity Scenarios** 
     Users can apply the mappings to conduct strategic adversarial simulations, including 
     red teaming and penetration testing, to effectively evaluate real-world risks across 
     the attack surface. The mappings can also be used to conduct collaborative cyber 
     tabletop exercises that more passively evaluate adversarial risks and the employed 
     organizational mitigating security technologies.

**Improved Security Architecture and Operations** 
     Users can use the mapped information to more easily identify security control gaps 
     to protect systems and environments from threats, develop detections for adversary 
     activity, and plan appropriate response activities across their IT/OT environment.

User Stories
------------

This section describes `user stories<https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories>_` based on the roles identified above.

**As an IR professional, I want to ensure I have a complete picture of an active security incident:**
     The Defending OT with ATT&CK mappings provide a framework to comprehensively describe 
     adversary behaviors at a flexible level across multiple platforms and technology domains. 
     The mappings allow IR professionals to understand the details of adversary activities 
     associated with an incident, which can assist in real-time decision making and response. 
     Additionally, the mappings can assist responders in looking for additional artifacts that 
     typically coexist with the currently observed activity.

**As a CISO/ISSO, I want to understand how our current security posture addresses real-world threats that my organization is likely to encounter:**
     Defending OT with ATT&CK provides a customized collection of ATT&CK techniques tailored 
     to the attack surface and threat model for OT environments. The resulting resources can 
     be used to conduct threat vector based compromise scenarios based on real-world adversary 
     behaviors targeting IT/OT environments. These scenarios provide understanding of actual 
     threats and risks and that knowledge can be applied to evaluate and employ appropriate 
     security controls and mitigations.

**As a SOC analyst, I need to know that we have sufficient visibility into threats launched against my organization:**
     The Defending OT with ATT&CK resources can be used by SOC analysts to evaluate and employ 
     security monitoring for real-world adversary behaviors associated specifically with OT 
     systems and environments. Visiting the narrative pages for the mapped ATT&CK techniques and 
     sub-techniques will provide information about behavior detections and often include links 
     to available tools. This information can help SOC teams find and fix blind spots or serve 
     to test that the existing detections are effective.

**As a SE, I want to understand what mitigations are necessary to prevent classes of attacker activity:**
     SEs can use the Defending OT with ATT&CK resources to evaluate and employ security controls 
     and mitigations for real-world adversary behaviors associated specifically with attacks targeting 
     OT systems and environments. Most ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques include information about 
     relevant mitigations, and examination and correlation of these can suggest control improvements 
     that can mitigate entire classes of adversary activity as well as individual threats.
