Threat Collection
=================

The Defending OT with ATT&CK threat collection is a customized collection of MITRE
ATT&CKÂ® techniques tailored to the attack surface and threat model for OT environments.
Historical attacks against OT and adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
as contained in ATT&CK for Enterprise, ATT&CK for ICS, and other relevant ATT&CK
datasets such as Cloud and Containers were analyzed to identify and define a reference
architecture and technology domains of interest specific to OT. The resultant collection
can be used by organizations that use OT to evaluate, plan, and employ security controls
based on known, real-world adversary behaviors targeting those environments.

Defending OT with ATT&CK provides a defined threat collection to assist defenders in
understanding which techniques adversaries could use within an IT/OT hybrid
architecture. This includes:

* Techniques that occur on enterprise systems used to manage OT.
* Techniques on Industrial Control Systems (ICS).
* Techniques on OT assets that run similar operating systems, protocols, and applications as enterprise IT assets.

Defending OT with ATT&CK builds upon the methodology from `Defending IaaS with ATT&CK
<https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/defending-iaas-with-attack/>`_ and
the tools from `ATT&CK Workbench
<https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend/blob/master/README.md>`_,
which are prior Center projects. The Defending IAAS methodology provides steps to
identify and select techniques across multiple ATT&CK matrices that align to a defined
attack surface, proving to be a solid foundation for developing Defending OT project
resources.

ATT&CK Workbench is a platform to explore and map adversarial techniques, target assets,
and campaigns. The Defending OT project employed ATT&CK Workbench's search and filter
features for ATT&CK for Enterprise and ATT&CK for ICS domains, determined mapping of
assets to multi-domains from ATT&CK for Enterprise and ATT&CK for ICS techniques, and
added rationale in Workbench's note sections, to generate the shared mapping file.
ATT&CK Workbench enables a number of important use cases within the ATT&CK community,
such as:

* **Cyber Threat Intelligence:** Take notes on techniques, groups, and other objects to
  collaborate within a threat intelligence team.
* **Red Teaming:** Track and manage coverage of Red Team engagements the same way you
  track your ATT&CK coverage.
* **Defensive Planning:** Stay up to date with the evolving threat landscape by
  downloading new releases of ATT&CK automatically.
* **Collaboration with ATT&CK and the community:** Share your custom datasets with the
  ATT&CK community and download datasets created by others.
