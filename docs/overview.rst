Overview
========

Organizations need to understand which techniques adversaries can use against 
Operational Technology (OT) systems. This includes and is not limited to:
* techniques that occur on enterprise systems used to manage OT,
* techniques on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), and
* techniques on OT assets that run similar operating systems, protocols, and applications as enterprise IT assets.

Defending OT with ATT&CK provides a customized collection of MITRE ATT&CK® 
techniques tailored to the attack surface and threat model for OT environments. 
Techniques in ATT&CK for Enterprise, ATT&CK for ICS, and other relevant ATT&CK
datasets such as Cloud and Containers were analyzed to identify and tag those 
that apply to OT. This collection can be used by organizations that use OT to 
evalaute and employ security controls based on real-world adversary behaviors.

Background
----------
`MITRE ATT&CK®<https://attack.mitre.org/>` is a globally accessible knowledge 
base of cyber adversary tactics and techniques based on public reporting and 
observation. The ATT&CK knowledge base represents adversary goals as tactics 
and specific goal-oriented behaviors as techniques and sub-techniques. Defending 
OT with ATT&CK leverages the knowledgebase and its underlying data model to 
produce a collection of ATT&CK techniques tailored to OT environments.

Initially, ATT&CK was focused on the Windows enterprise environment. Later versions 
integrated macOS and Linux into what is commonly known as “ATT&CK for Enterprise”. 
With broader adoption and numerous contributions from the cybersecurity community, 
ATT&CK eventually added Mobile and ICS technology domains.

A typical OT environment spans multiple platforms (e.g., Linux and Microsoft Azure) 
and even spans technology domains (e.g., Enterprise and ICS). These complex environments 
require cyber defenders to track adversary behaviors that are defined across multiple 
matrices and platforms in the ATT&CK knowledgebase. Keeping track of techniques across 
different ATT&CK matrices can be difficult, and some techniques may not apply to a 
particular environment or architecture. To that end, this project defines a reference 
architecture and a corresponding attack surface, then creates mappings of relevant 
techniques from multiple matrices to provide a single, convenient collection of resources.

Get Started
-----------

The mappings between ATT&CK for Enterprise and ATT&CK for ICS techniques provide 
an understanding of the attack surface and threat model for the various assets 
within an IT/OT hybrid architecture and environment. To get started using the
