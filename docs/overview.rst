Overview
========

Organizations need to understand which techniques adversaries can use against 
Operational Technology (OT) systems. This includes and is not limited to:
* techniques that occur on enterprise systems used to manage OT,
* techniques on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), and
* techniques on OT assets that run similar operating systems, protocols, and applications as enterprise IT assets.

Defending OT with ATT&CK provides a customized collection of MITRE ATT&CKÂ® 
techniques tailored to the attack surface and threat model for OT environments. 
Techniques in ATT&CK for Enterprise, ATT&CK for ICS, and other relevant ATT&CK
datasets such as Cloud and Containers were analyzed to identify and tag those 
that apply to OT. This collection can be used by organizations that use OT to 
evalaute and employ security controls based on real-world adversary behaviors.
