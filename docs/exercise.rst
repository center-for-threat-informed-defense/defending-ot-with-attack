=======================

An ATT&CK-based scenario cyber tabletop exercise was conducted based upon the 
`2022 Ukraine Electric Power Attack<https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0034/>_` campaign. This real-world campaign by the 
Russian threat actor group known as Sandworm Team used a combination of 15 
techniques overlapping ATT&CK for Enterprise and ICS domains to gain access to 
a Ukranian electric utility and send unauthorized commands to substation devices.
