Defending Operational Technology (OT) with ATT&CK
=================================================

Defending OT with ATT&CK provides a customized collection of `MITRE ATT&CK® <https://attack.mitre.org/>`_ techniques 
tailored to the attack surface and threat model for OT environments. The collection of 
threats contained in the ATT&CK knowledgebase, including historical attacks against OT,
are used to define a reference architecture and technology domains of interest for OT. 
The resultant collection can be used by organizations that use OT to evaluate and employ 
security controls for real-world adversary behaviors.

This project is created and maintained by `MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense (Center) <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/>`_
and is funded by our research participants, in futherance of our mission to advance the state 
of the art and the state of the practice in threat-informed defense globally. This work builds upon the 
Center's `Defending IaaS with ATT&CK <https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/our-work/defending-iaas-with-attack/>`_ project by 
using the methodology and tooling created under that project as a basis, and provides another collection
of resources cyber defenders can use to understand and make threat-informed decisions for techniques that 
could be used within an IT/OT hybrid architecture and environment.
