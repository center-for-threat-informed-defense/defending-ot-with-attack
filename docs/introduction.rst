Introduction
============

..  TODO Add any chapters you wish as separate *.rst files that are referenced in the
    index.rst. This file can contain an introduction if you want, or delete it and
    create other chapters.

Organizations need to understand which techniques adversaries can use against Operational 
Technology (OT) systems. This includes:
* techniques that occur on enterprise systems used to manage OT;
* techniques on Industrial Control Systems (ICS); and
* techniques on OT assets that run similar operating systems, protocols, and applications as enterprise IT assets.

Defending OT with ATT&CK provides a customized collection of MITRE ATT&CKÂ® techniques 
tailored to the attack surface and threat model for OT. The project entailed reviewing 
tactics and techniques in ATT&CK for Enterprise and ATT&CK for ICSReview techniques, as 
well as historical attacks against OT to define a reference architecture and technology 
domains of interest for OT. The resultant collection can be used to plan and evaluate 
security controls for organizations that use OT based on the known adversary behaviors 
as described in ATT&CK.
